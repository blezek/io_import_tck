# MRtrix streamline importer for Blender

[MRtrix](https://www.mrtrix.org/) is a set of tools to analyze MRI diffusion images.  This [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) plugin imports th MRtrix [streamline format files](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html#tracks-file-format-tck) as Blender curve objects.

## Introduction

[tckconvert](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/commands/tckconvert.html) can export streamlines in [PLY](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/), [RIB files for RenderMan](https://renderman.pixar.com/) and [VTK poly format](https://vtk.org/), however, each of these exports involves a conversion to polygons.  [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is increasingly used for scientific visualization and is a great tool for creating renderings.  Streamlines can now be imported into Blender using an [open source plugin released on GitHub](https://github.com/blezek/io_import_tck).


## Installation

1. Download the [plugin as a zip file](https://github.com/blezek/io_import_tck/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. [Open Blender, open settings and use the "Add-ons" tab to install](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html)
3. Navigate to the downloaded zip file
4. Enable in the Add-ons tab
5. Use "File / Import / MRtrix streamlines (.tck)" to import streamline files

## Import options

- `Max points`: MRtrix streamlines generated by `tckgen` often have sub-voxel spaced points resulting in huge numbers of points per streamline.  This setting limits each streamline to a maximum number of points by skipping points.  Usually curve interpolation is sufficient to accurately represent the streamlines.
- `Radius`: sets the curve's `Bevel depth` to construct a tubular structure, uses the same units as the next option.
- `In mm`: if set, the streamlines are imported in with physical scaling in millimeters, resulting in very small structures as Blender's default unit is meters.  If unchecked, streamlines are imported in meters, resulting in very large structures.
